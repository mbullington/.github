## Hi, I'm Michael!

I'm a software developer who's passionate about building user interfaces. I currently work on Mapbox Studio. I have a deep (but not complete by any means!) knowledge of client-side JavaScript architecture :hammer:, mapping technologies :globe_with_meridians:, and am currently excited by Flutter :hatched_chick:. Fan of travel!
