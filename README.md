## Hi, I'm Michael!

I'm a software developer who's passionate about product design. I work on things mostly out of excitement and curiosity. Looking to make a positive impact in the world through computing.

I currently work on Mapbox on Search, previously Mapbox Studio.  You can check out my projects below, visit [my personal site](https://bullington.xyz), or [get in touch!](mailto:michael@bullington.xyz)
